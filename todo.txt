=== TODOs before first release ===

Layout:
x Have a first final layout: 
  - Background color, consistent button-style
x Add clean, consistent style to all options.
o Get an idea how it looks a mobile device and adapt if necessary.
  o Maximize used screen size.
  x Have a fixed size for the dice area. No more change of the container-size
    when adding or removing dice. (Content+Footer)
  o Have something like "Takes 100% window size but at most 40cmx60cm" for
    container sizes. It should take 100% on mobile devices (even those with 
    large resolution) and be rather small on large classical screens. The 
    second could be achieved by scaling the window by hand.
  o No moving control-panel when adding or removing dice.
X Allow for scalable dice: Either include SVG into html with scaling as ng-
  parameter or scale inside the SVGs.
o Center the dice vertically.

Deployment:
o Test the application in various browsers (at least, FF, Chromium, IE (current)
  and Opera). Test it in jsfiddle before.
o Prepare the Chrome Web Store deployment steps for the dice application.
o Have some place to host the project (Chrome Web Store).
o Monetization 
  o Have some information about me, at least a contact email address. 
  o Add a link to the projects github page, start a feedback tracker there.
  o Add a "Share"-button: Creates a screenshot from the current dice-result, 
    encapsulated in a link to the dice-app, which can be shared on facebook.

"Configuration"-area: 
X - Resort to meaningful actions:
  x 1. Number of dice, add and remove. Have a senseful maximum number. 


=== Future TODOs ===

Layout
o Cleanup HTML: Separate nicely between markup, CSS and scripting.
o Show an animation and have a short delay when rolling is initiated.
o Adapt scaling and position of the dice to the number (center dice, reduce 
  scale when adding dice)
o Show configuration only on "mouse-hover"
o Add shadows for border and dice.
o Center the dice vertically.
o Use fast-click, if delay is a problem for the 'feel' of the app.
o Use 'Normalize.css' for a consistent style.

Compatibility
o Add fallback for browsers which do not support inline SVG:
  <!--[if (gt IE 8)]><!--><svg></svg><!--<![endif]-->

Code
o Clean up the code, in case anybody has a look into it (potential employers).
  o Separate markup (html) and layout (css)

Performance
o Experiment with different SVg styles: Inline, external, separate files for
  each eye-count.
o Make sure that the dices are just painted once, after the white-box has its size
  and that the compute_edge_length() function is called only once.

Deployment
o Add a link to a project page, e.g. on sternisko.com.
o Add an ad-banner.
o Remove sternisko.com's content or make it Ã¶ffentlichkeitswirksam.

"Configuration"-area
  2. Color of dice: Have a stylish selection.
  3. Select "eye-style": show eyes or numbers on each die
  4. Enable/disable delay with animation.
